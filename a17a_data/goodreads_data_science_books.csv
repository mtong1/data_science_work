Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,29496091," Deep Learning  <br /> <br />Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game. <br /> <br />Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated! <br /> <br />While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill. <br /> <br />All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU. <br /> <br />Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces. <br /> <br />On top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful. <br /> <br />Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you. <br /> <br /> Who is this book NOT for?  <br /> <br />Deep Learning and Neural Networks are usually taught at the upper-year undergraduate level. That should give you some idea of the type of knowledge you need to understand this kind of material. <br /> <br />You absolutely need exposure to calculus to understand deep learning, no matter how simple the instructor makes things. Linear algebra would help. I will assume familiarity with Python (although it is an easy language to pick up). You will need to have some concept of machine learning. If you know about algorithms like logistic regression already, this book is perfect for you. If not, you might want to check out my “prerequisites” book, at: http://amzn.com/B01D7GDRQ2 <br /> <br />On the other hand, this book is more like a casual primer than a dry textbook. If you are looking for material on more advanced topics, like LSTMs, convolutional neural networks, or reinforcement learning, I have online courses that teach this material, for example: https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-c... <br /> <br />New libraries like TensorFlow are being updated constantly. This is not an encyclopedia for these libraries (as such a thing would be impossible to keep up to date). In the one (1!!!) month since the book was first published, no less than THREE new wrapper libraries for TensorFlow have been released to make coding deep networks easier.",57.0,39,1,,"March 11, 2016",3.54,"Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow"

Avrim Blum,ebook,25426657,"Computer science as an academic discipline began in the 1960’s. Emphasis was on programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and the mathematical theory that supported these areas. Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, and computability. In the 1970’s, the study of algorithms was added as an important component of theory. The emphasis was on making computers useful. Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on a wealth of applications. There are many reasons for this change. The merging of computing and communications has played an important role. The enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in the natural sciences, in commerce, and in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting. The emergence of the web and social networks as central aspects of daily life presents both opportunities and challenges for theory.<br /><br />While traditional areas of computer science remain highly important, increasingly researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this in mind we have written this book to cover the theory we expect to be useful in the next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and related topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years. One of the major changes is an increase in emphasis on probability, statistics, and numerical methods.<br /><br />Early drafts of the book have been used for both undergraduate and graduate courses. Background material needed for an undergraduate course has been put in the appendix. For this reason, the appendix has homework problems.",479.0,21,4,,"January 1, 2015",4.19,Foundations of Data Science

Avrim Blum,ebook,25426657,"Computer science as an academic discipline began in the 1960’s. Emphasis was on programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and the mathematical theory that supported these areas. Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, and computability. In the 1970’s, the study of algorithms was added as an important component of theory. The emphasis was on making computers useful. Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on a wealth of applications. There are many reasons for this change. The merging of computing and communications has played an important role. The enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in the natural sciences, in commerce, and in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting. The emergence of the web and social networks as central aspects of daily life presents both opportunities and challenges for theory.<br /><br />While traditional areas of computer science remain highly important, increasingly researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this in mind we have written this book to cover the theory we expect to be useful in the next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and related topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years. One of the major changes is an increase in emphasis on probability, statistics, and numerical methods.<br /><br />Early drafts of the book have been used for both undergraduate and graduate courses. Background material needed for an undergraduate course has been put in the appendix. For this reason, the appendix has homework problems.",479.0,21,4,,"January 1, 2015",4.19,Foundations of Data Science

Nicolas Vandeput,Paperback,43081723,"Data Science for Supply Chain Forecast is a book for practitioners focusing on data science and machine learning; it demonstrates how both are closely interlinked in order to create an advanced forecast for supply chain. As one will discover in this book, artificial intelligence (AI) &amp; machine learning (ML) are not simply a question of coding skills. Using data science in order to solve a problem requires a scientific mindset more than coding skills. The story behind these models is one of experimentation, of observation and of constant questioning; a true scientific method must be applied to supply chain. In the data science field as well as that of the supply chain, simple questions do not come with simple answers. In order to resolve these questions, one needs to be both a scientist as well as to use the correct tools. In this book, we will discuss both. This book has been written for supply chain practitioners, forecasters and analysts who are looking to go the extra mile. You do not need technical IT skills to start using the models of this book. You do not need a dedicated server or expensive software you solely need your own computer. You do not need a PhD in mathematics will only be utilized as a tool to tweak and understand the models. In the majority of the cases – especially when it comes to machine learning – a deep understanding of the mathematical inner workings of a model will not be necessary in order to optimize it and understand its limitations. ""In an age where analytics and machine learning are taking on larger roles in the business forecasting, Nicolas’ book is perfect solution for professionals who need to combine practical supply chain experience with the mathematical and technological tools that can help us predict the future more reliably.""<br />Daniel Stanton - Author, Supply Chain Management For Dummies<br />""Open source statistical toolkits have progressed tremendously over the last decade. Nicolas demonstrates that these toolkits are more than enough to start addressing real-world forecasting challenges as found in supply chains. Moreover, through its hands-on approach, this book is accessible to a large audience of supply chain practitioners. The supply chain of the 21st century will be data-driven and Nicolas gets it perfectly.""<br />Joannes Vermorel - CEO Lokad<br />“This book is unique in its kind. It explains the basics of Python using basic traditional forecasting techniques and shows how machine learning is revolutionizing the forecasting domain. Nicolas has done an outstanding job explaining a technical subject in an easily accessible way. A must-read for any supply chain professional.”<br />Professor Bram Desmet - CEO Solventure<br />“This book is before anything a practical and business-oriented “DIY” user manual to help planners move into 21st-century demand planning. The breakthrough comes from several tools and techniques available to all, and which thanks to Nicolas' precise and concrete explanations can now be implemented in real business environments by any “normal” planner.

LazyProgrammer,Kindle Edition,32499062,"Markov Models are all about learning sequences.<br /><br />A lot of the data that would be very useful for us to model is in sequences. Stock prices are sequences of prices. Language is a sequence of words. Credit scoring involves sequences of borrowing and repaying money, and we can use those sequences to predict whether or not you’re going to default. In short, sequences are everywhere.<br /><br />The easiest way to appreciate the kind of information you get from a sequence is to consider what you are reading right now. If I had printed the previous sentence backwards, it wouldn’t make much sense to you, even though it contained all the same words. So order is important.<br /><br />While the current fad in deep learning is to use recurrent neural networks (LSTM) to model sequences, I want to first introduce you guys to a machine learning algorithm that has been around for several decades now - the Markov Model.<br /><br />This book follows directly from my first course in Unsupervised Machine Learning for Cluster Analysis, where you learned how to measure the probability distribution of a random variable. In this course, you’ll learn to measure the probability distribution of a sequence of random variables.<br /><br />This course is also going to go through the many practical applications of Markov models. We’re going to look at a model of sickness and health, and calculate how to predict how long you’ll stay sick, if you get sick. We’re going to talk about how Markov models can be used to analyze how people interact with your website, and fix problem areas like high bounce rate, which could be affecting your SEO. We’ll build language models that can be used to identify a writer and even generate text - imagine a machine doing your writing for you.<br /><br />We’ll look at what is possibly the most recent and prolific application of Markov models - Google’s PageRank algorithm. It is surprising that the world's leading search engine could have made its money on what is essentially an undergraduate linear algebra problem.<br /><br />If you think Markov models aren't relevant to your life, think again. Even smartphone autosuggestions can be programmed using Markov models.<br /><br />Amazingly, all the technologies we discuss in this book can be downloaded and installed for FREE.

Nicolas Vandeput,Paperback,43081723,"Data Science for Supply Chain Forecast is a book for practitioners focusing on data science and machine learning; it demonstrates how both are closely interlinked in order to create an advanced forecast for supply chain. As one will discover in this book, artificial intelligence (AI) &amp; machine learning (ML) are not simply a question of coding skills. Using data science in order to solve a problem requires a scientific mindset more than coding skills. The story behind these models is one of experimentation, of observation and of constant questioning; a true scientific method must be applied to supply chain. In the data science field as well as that of the supply chain, simple questions do not come with simple answers. In order to resolve these questions, one needs to be both a scientist as well as to use the correct tools. In this book, we will discuss both. This book has been written for supply chain practitioners, forecasters and analysts who are looking to go the extra mile. You do not need technical IT skills to start using the models of this book. You do not need a dedicated server or expensive software you solely need your own computer. You do not need a PhD in mathematics will only be utilized as a tool to tweak and understand the models. In the majority of the cases – especially when it comes to machine learning – a deep understanding of the mathematical inner workings of a model will not be necessary in order to optimize it and understand its limitations. ""In an age where analytics and machine learning are taking on larger roles in the business forecasting, Nicolas’ book is perfect solution for professionals who need to combine practical supply chain experience with the mathematical and technological tools that can help us predict the future more reliably.""<br />Daniel Stanton - Author, Supply Chain Management For Dummies<br />""Open source statistical toolkits have progressed tremendously over the last decade. Nicolas demonstrates that these toolkits are more than enough to start addressing real-world forecasting challenges as found in supply chains.

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,29496091," Deep Learning  <br /> <br />Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game. <br /> <br />Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated! <br /> <br />While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill. <br /> <br />All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU. <br /> <br />Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces. <br /> <br />On top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful. <br /> <br />Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you. <br /> <br /> Who is this book NOT for?  <br /> <br />Deep Learning and Neural Networks are usually taught at the upper-year undergraduate level. That should give you some idea of the type of knowledge you need to understand this kind of material. <br /> <br />You absolutely need exposure to calculus to understand deep learning, no matter how simple the instructor makes things. Linear algebra would help. I will assume familiarity with Python (although it is an easy language to pick up). You will need to have some concept of machine learning. If you know about algorithms like logistic regression already, this book is perfect for you. If not, you might want to check out my “prerequisites” book, at: http://amzn.com/B01D7GDRQ2 <br /> <br />On the other hand, this book is more like a casual primer than a dry textbook. If you are looking for material on more advanced topics, like LSTMs, convolutional neural networks, or reinforcement learning, I have online courses that teach this material, for example: https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-c... <br /> <br />New libraries like TensorFlow are being updated constantly.

Sandra González-Bailón,Hardcover,34540106,"<b>How data science and the analysis of networks help us solve the puzzle of unintended consequences.</b><br /><br />Social life is full of paradoxes. Our intentional actions often trigger outcomes that we did not intend or even envision. How do we explain those unintended effects and what can we do to regulate them? In <em>Decoding the Social World</em>, Sandra González-Bailón explains how data science and digital traces help us solve the puzzle of unintended consequences—offering the solution to a social paradox that has intrigued thinkers for centuries. Communication has always been the force that makes a collection of people more than the sum of individuals, but only now can we explain why: digital technologies have made it possible to parse the information we generate by being social in new, imaginative ways. And yet we must look at that data, González-Bailón argues, through the lens of theories that capture the nature of social life. The technologies we use, in the end, are also a manifestation of the social world we inhabit.<br /><br />González-Bailón discusses how the unpredictability of social life relates to communication networks, social influence, and the unintended effects that derive from individual decisions. She describes how communication generates social dynamics in aggregate (leading to episodes of “collective effervescence”) and discusses the mechanisms that underlie large-scale diffusion, when information and behavior spread “like wildfire.” She applies the theory of networks to illuminate why collective outcomes can differ drastically even when they arise from the same individual actions. By opening the black box of unintended effects, González-Bailón identifies strategies for social intervention and discusses the policy implications—and how data science and evidence-based research embolden critical thinking in a world that is constantly changing.",256.0,13,2,The MIT Press,"December 22, 2017",4.0,Decoding the Social World: Data Science and the Unintended Consequences of Communication

LazyProgrammer,Kindle Edition,32499062,"Markov Models are all about learning sequences.<br /><br />A lot of the data that would be very useful for us to model is in sequences. Stock prices are sequences of prices. Language is a sequence of words. Credit scoring involves sequences of borrowing and repaying money, and we can use those sequences to predict whether or not you’re going to default. In short, sequences are everywhere.<br /><br />The easiest way to appreciate the kind of information you get from a sequence is to consider what you are reading right now. If I had printed the previous sentence backwards, it wouldn’t make much sense to you, even though it contained all the same words. So order is important.<br /><br />While the current fad in deep learning is to use recurrent neural networks (LSTM) to model sequences, I want to first introduce you guys to a machine learning algorithm that has been around for several decades now - the Markov Model.<br /><br />This book follows directly from my first course in Unsupervised Machine Learning for Cluster Analysis, where you learned how to measure the probability distribution of a random variable. In this course, you’ll learn to measure the probability distribution of a sequence of random variables.<br /><br />This course is also going to go through the many practical applications of Markov models. We’re going to look at a model of sickness and health, and calculate how to predict how long you’ll stay sick, if you get sick. We’re going to talk about how Markov models can be used to analyze how people interact with your website, and fix problem areas like high bounce rate, which could be affecting your SEO. We’ll build language models that can be used to identify a writer and even generate text - imagine a machine doing your writing for you.<br /><br />We’ll look at what is possibly the most recent and prolific application of Markov models - Google’s PageRank algorithm. It is surprising that the world's leading search engine could have made its money on what is essentially an undergraduate linear algebra problem.<br /><br />If you think Markov models aren't relevant to your life, think again. Even smartphone autosuggestions can be programmed using Markov models.<br /><br />Amazingly, all the technologies we discuss in this book can be downloaded and installed for FREE.

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,29614270," Do you find deep learning difficult? <br /><br />So you want to learn about deep learning and neural networks, but you don’t have a clue what machine learning even is. This book is for you.<br /><br />Perhaps you’ve already tried to read some tutorials about deep learning, and were just left scratching your head because you did not understand any of it. This book is for you.<br /><br />Believe the hype. Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game.<br /><br />Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated!<br /><br />While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the prerequisites of neural networks, so that learning about neural networks in the future will seem like a natural extension of these topics. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill.<br /><br />All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy.<br /><br />Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will eventually let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network is made up of logistic regression units.<br /><br />Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you.<br /><br />This book was designed to contain all the prerequisite information you need for my next book, Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow.<br /><br />There are many techniques that you should be comfortable with before diving into deep learning. For example, the “backpropagation” algorithm is just gradient descent, which is the same technique that is used to solve logistic regression.<br /><br />The error functions and output functions of a neural network are exactly the same as those used in linear regression and logistic regression. The training process is nearly identical. Thus, learning about linear regression and logistic regression before you embark on your deep learning journey will make things much, much simpler for you.<br /><br /> Required resources <br /><br />Following this book does not require any external materials.

It is primarily addressed at students and professionals who need to draw quantitative conclusions from experimental data. Although most of the examples are taken from particle physics, the material is presented in a sufficiently general way as to be useful to people from most branches of the physical sciences. The first part of the book describes the basic tools of data concepts of probability and random variables, Monte Carlo techniques, statistical tests, and methods of parameter estimation. The last three chapters then develop more advanced statistical ideas, focusing on interval estimation, characteristic functions, and correcting distributions for the effects of measurement errors (unfolding).",216.0,30,1,Clarendon Press,"December 4, 1997",4.23,Statistical Data Analysis

Sandra González-Bailón,Hardcover,34540106,"<b>How data science and the analysis of networks help us solve the puzzle of unintended consequences.</b><br /><br />Social life is full of paradoxes. Our intentional actions often trigger outcomes that we did not intend or even envision. How do we explain those unintended effects and what can we do to regulate them? In <em>Decoding the Social World</em>, Sandra González-Bailón explains how data science and digital traces help us solve the puzzle of unintended consequences—offering the solution to a social paradox that has intrigued thinkers for centuries. Communication has always been the force that makes a collection of people more than the sum of individuals, but only now can we explain why: digital technologies have made it possible to parse the information we generate by being social in new, imaginative ways. And yet we must look at that data, González-Bailón argues, through the lens of theories that capture the nature of social life. The technologies we use, in the end, are also a manifestation of the social world we inhabit.<br /><br />González-Bailón discusses how the unpredictability of social life relates to communication networks, social influence, and the unintended effects that derive from individual decisions. She describes how communication generates social dynamics in aggregate (leading to episodes of “collective effervescence”) and discusses the mechanisms that underlie large-scale diffusion, when information and behavior spread “like wildfire.” She applies the theory of networks to illuminate why collective outcomes can differ drastically even when they arise from the same individual actions. By opening the black box of unintended effects, González-Bailón identifies strategies for social intervention and discusses the policy implications—and how data science and evidence-based research embolden critical thinking in a world that is constantly changing.",256.0,13,2,The MIT Press,"December 22, 2017",4.0,Decoding the Social World: Data Science and the Unintended Consequences of Communication

Thorsten Hennig-Thurau,Hardcover,39988267,"The entertainment industry has long been dominated by legendary screenwriter William Goldman’s “Nobody-Knows-Anything” mantra, which argues that success is the result of managerial intuition and instinct. This book builds the case that combining such intuition with data analytics and rigorous scholarly knowledge provides a source of sustainable competitive advantage – the same recipe for success that is behind the rise of firms such as Netflix and Spotify, but has also fueled Disney’s recent success. Unlocking a large repertoire of scientific studies by business scholars and entertainment economists, the authors identify essential factors, mechanisms, and methods that help a new entertainment product succeed. The book thus offers a timely alternative to “Nobody-Knows” decision-making in the digital while coupling a good idea with smart data analytics and entertainment theory cannot guarantee a hit, it systematically and substantially increases the probability of success in the entertainment industry. Entertainment Science is poised to inspire fresh new thinking among managers, students of entertainment, and scholars alike. Thorsten Hennig-Thurau and Mark B.

Andrew Park,Kindle Edition,49672564,"Everyone talks about data today. You have probably come across the term “data” more times than you can remember in one day. Data as a concept is so wide. One thing that is true about data is that it can be used to tell a story. The story could be anything from explaining an event to predicting the future. Data is the future . Businesses, governments, organizations, criminals—everyone needs data for some reason. Entities are investing in different data approaches to help them understand their current situation, and use it to prepare for the unknown. The world of technology as we know it is evolving towards an open-source platform where people share ideas freely. This is seen as the first step towards the decentralization of ideas and eliminating unnecessary monopolies. Therefore, the data, tools, and techniques used in the analysis are easily available for anyone to interpret data sets and get relevant explanations.<br />While most books focus on how to implement advanced predictive models, this book takes the time to explain the basic concepts and all the necessary steps to correctly implement Data Analysis, including Data Visualization and providing practical examples and simple coding scripts. Don't miss the opportunity to learn more about these topics. Even if you never used Data Analysis, learning it is easier than it looks, you just need the right guidance. This practical guide provides all the knowledge you need in a simple and practical way.  Regardless of your previous experience,  you will learn the steps of Data Analysis, how to implement them in Python, and the most important real-world applications.<br />Would You Like To Know More?",153.0,6,1,,"December 17, 2019",3.0,"Python for Data Analysis: A Step By Step Guide to Master the Basics of Data Analysis in Python Using Pandas, Numpy And Ipython"

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,30238998,"This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in Theano and TensorFlow, and you know how to run code using the GPU. <br /> <br />This book is all about how to use deep learning for computer vision using convolutional neural networks. These are the state of the art when it comes to image classification and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST. <br /> <br />In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the StreetView House Number (SVHN) dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles - so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge! <br /> <br />Because convolution is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as modeling artificial organs like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to audio, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for image effects, like the Gaussian blur and edge detection. <br /> <br />After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset. <br /> <br />All the materials used in this book are FREE. You can download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Theano, and TensorFlow with pip or easy_install. <br /> <br />Lastly, my goal is to show you that convolutional networks aren’t magical and they don’t require expert-level math to figure out. <br /> <br />It’s just the same thing we had with regular neural networks: <br /> <br />y = softmax( relu(X.dot(W1).dot(W2) ) <br /> <br />Except we replace the first “dot product” with a convolution: <br /> <br />y = softmax( relu(conv(X, W1)).dot(W2) ) <br /> <br />The way they are trained is exactly the same as before, so all your skills with backpropagation, etc. carry over.",52.0,15,1,,"May 15, 2016",3.53,"Convolutional Neural Networks in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Deep Learning in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow"

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,30333785,"In a real-world environment, you can imagine that a robot or an artificial intelligence won’t always have access to the optimal answer, or maybe there isn’t an optimal correct answer. You’d want that robot to be able to explore the world on its own, and learn things just by looking for patterns. <br /> <br />Think about the large amounts of data being collected today, by the likes of the NSA, Google, and other organizations. No human could possibly sift through all that data manually. It was reported recently in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal that the National Security Agency collects so much surveillance data, it is no longer effective. <br /> <br />Could automated pattern discovery solve this problem? <br /> <br />Do you ever wonder how we get the data that we use in our supervised machine learning algorithms? <br /> <br />Kaggle always seems to provide us with a nice CSV, complete with Xs and corresponding Ys. <br /> <br />If you haven’t been involved in acquiring data yourself, you might not have thought about this, but someone has to make this data! <br /> <br />A lot of the time this involves manual labor. Sometimes, you don’t have access to the correct information or it is infeasible or costly to acquire. <br /> <br />You still want to have some idea of the structure of the data. <br /> <br />This is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play. <br /> <br />In this book we are first going to talk about clustering. This is where instead of training on labels, we try to create our own labels. We’ll do this by grouping together data that looks alike. <br /> <br />The 2 methods of clustering we’ll talk about: k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. <br /> <br />Next, because in machine learning we like to talk about probability distributions, we’ll go into Gaussian mixture models and kernel density estimation, where we talk about how to learn the probability distribution of a set of data. <br /> <br />One interesting fact is that under certain conditions, Gaussian mixture models and k-means clustering are exactly the same! We’ll prove how this is the case. <br /> <br />Lastly, we’ll look at the theory behind principal components analysis or PCA. PCA has many useful applications: visualization, dimensionality reduction, denoising, and de-correlation. You will see how it allows us to take a different perspective on latent variables, which first appear when we talk about k-means clustering and GMMs. <br /> <br />All the algorithms we’ll talk about in this course are staples in machine learning and data science, so if you want to know how to automatically find patterns in your data with data mining and pattern extraction, without needing someone to put in manual work to label that data, then this book is for you. <br /> <br />All of the materials required to follow along in this book are free: You just need to able to download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Sci-kit Learn.",57.0,14,1,,"May 22, 2016",3.64,"Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Cluster Analysis, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Principal Components Analysis"

This book is for you.<br /><br />Perhaps you’ve already tried to read some tutorials about deep learning, and were just left scratching your head because you did not understand any of it. This book is for you.<br /><br />Believe the hype. Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game.<br /><br />Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated!<br /><br />While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the prerequisites of neural networks, so that learning about neural networks in the future will seem like a natural extension of these topics. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill.<br /><br />All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy.<br /><br />Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will eventually let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network is made up of logistic regression units.<br /><br />Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you.<br /><br />This book was designed to contain all the prerequisite information you need for my next book, Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow.<br /><br />There are many techniques that you should be comfortable with before diving into deep learning. For example, the “backpropagation” algorithm is just gradient descent, which is the same technique that is used to solve logistic regression.<br /><br />The error functions and output functions of a neural network are exactly the same as those used in linear regression and logistic regression. The training process is nearly identical. Thus, learning about linear regression and logistic regression before you embark on your deep learning journey will make things much, much simpler for you.<br /><br /> Required resources <br /><br />Following this book does not require any external materials.

AI Publishing,Kindle Edition,51236067,"This book is for you. This book works as guide to present fundamental Python Libraries and basis related to Data Visualization using Python. Data science and data visualization are two different but interrelated concepts. Data science refers to the science of extracting and exploring data in order to find patterns that can be used for decision making at different levels. Data visualization can be considered as a subdomain of data science where you visualize data with the help of graphs and tables in order to find out which data is most significant and can help in the identification of important patterns. This book is dedicated to data visualization and explains how to perform data visualization on a variety of datasets using various data visualization libraries written in the Python programming language. It is suggested that you use this book for data visualization purposes only and not for decision making. For decision making and pattern identification, read this book in conjunction with a dedicated book on machine learning and data science. We will start by digging into Python programming as all the projects are developed using it, and it is currently the most used programming language in the world. We will also explore the most-famous libraries for Data Visualization such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc . You will learn all about python in three modules, one for Plotting with Matplotlib, one for Plotting with Seaborn, and a final one Pandas for Data Visualization. All three modules will contain hands-on projects using real-world datasets and a lot of exercises. All solutions in this book are extensively tested by a group of beta readers. The solutions provided are simplified as much as possible so that they can serve as examples for you to refer to when you are learning a new skill. This book is written with one goal in mind – to help beginners overcome their initial obstacles to learning Data Visualization using Python. A lot of times, newbies tend to feel intimidated by coding and data. The goal of this book is to isolate the different concepts so that beginners can gradually gain competency in the fundamentals of Python before working on a project.

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,30526284,"Recently, Microsoft’s Twitter bot “Tay” was released into the wild, and quickly began making racist and hateful statements after learning from other Twitter users. The technology behind this? Natural language processing. <br /> <br />NLP is the use of machine learning algorithms for problems that involve text. <br /> <br />Do you ever wonder why you get much less spam in your inbox these days compared to 10 years ago? What kinds of algorithms are people using to do spam detection? How can they take words in an email and know how to compute whether or not it’s spam? In this book you are going to build your very own spam detector. <br /> <br />Did you know people have already used Twitter to determine the current sentiment about a particular company to decide whether or not they should buy or sell stocks? Having a machine that can decide how people feel about something is immensely useful and immediately applicable to revenue optimization. In this course you are going to build your own sentiment analyzer. <br /> <br />Are you an Internet marketer or are you interested in SEO? Have you ever wanted to know how you can automatically generate content? In this course we are going to take a first crack at building your own article spinner. You’ll learn to write programs that can take an article as input and spit out a similar article with different words as output. This can save you tons of time and thousands of dollars if you’re paying someone to write content for you. <br /> <br />Natural Language Processing, or as it is often abbreviated, NLP - is the use of programming and math to do language-based tasks. <br /> <br />If you have Windows or iOS then you have NLP right in front of you! Cortana and Siri are applications that take what you say and turn it into something meaningful that can be done programmatically. <br /> <br />The key point: NLP is highly practical. NLP is everywhere. <br /> <br />This book is split up into multiple sections based on the various practical tasks that you can do with NLP: <br /> <br />Before we do any real programming exercises we’ll look at common NLP tasks (some of these we will actually code ourselves, the others are mentioned so you at least know they exist). We will then look at common data pre-processing techniques used for text. As you’ll see, this preprocessing is what will actually take up a majority of your time when you’re doing NLP. <br /> <br />The first programming exercise we’ll do is look at how to build a spam detector. Your email inbox uses this, so it’s clearly very useful and it’s been the subject of study for a long time. <br /> <br />Next we’ll look at “sentiment analysis” and you’ll build your own “sentiment analyzer”. This is how a computer can judge how positive or negative some text is based on the words and phrases that are used. This is also immediately practical - some people have analyzed Twitter feeds to predict whether a stock would go up or down. <br /> <br />After that we’ll look at the NLTK library. This is a very popular library that solves a lot of fundamental problems in NLP - and you can use it in conjunction with other libraries in your data analysis pipeline. <br /> <br />Next we’ll look at “latent semantic analysis”. This is basically doing dimensionality reduction on text - and it helps us solve the problem of 2 words having the same meaning. It also helps us interpret our data and save on computation time. <br /> <br />Lastly, we’ll talk about one of the most popular applications of NLP - article spinning. This is very practical for internet marketers and entrepreneurs.",54.0,17,1,,"May 17, 2016",4.18,"Natural Language Processing in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning for spam detection, sentiment analysis, latent semantic analysis, and article spinning"

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,30238998,"This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in Theano and TensorFlow, and you know how to run code using the GPU. <br /> <br />This book is all about how to use deep learning for computer vision using convolutional neural networks. These are the state of the art when it comes to image classification and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST. <br /> <br />In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the StreetView House Number (SVHN) dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles - so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge! <br /> <br />Because convolution is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as modeling artificial organs like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to audio, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for image effects, like the Gaussian blur and edge detection. <br /> <br />After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset. <br /> <br />All the materials used in this book are FREE. You can download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Theano, and TensorFlow with pip or easy_install. <br /> <br />Lastly, my goal is to show you that convolutional networks aren’t magical and they don’t require expert-level math to figure out. <br /> <br />It’s just the same thing we had with regular neural networks: <br /> <br />y = softmax( relu(X.dot(W1).dot(W2) ) <br /> <br />Except we replace the first “dot product” with a convolution: <br /> <br />y = softmax( relu(conv(X, W1)).dot(W2) ) <br /> <br />The way they are trained is exactly the same as before, so all your skills with backpropagation, etc. carry over.",52.0,15,1,,"May 15, 2016",3.53,"Convolutional Neural Networks in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Deep Learning in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow"

Thorsten Hennig-Thurau,Hardcover,39988267,"The entertainment industry has long been dominated by legendary screenwriter William Goldman’s “Nobody-Knows-Anything” mantra, which argues that success is the result of managerial intuition and instinct. This book builds the case that combining such intuition with data analytics and rigorous scholarly knowledge provides a source of sustainable competitive advantage – the same recipe for success that is behind the rise of firms such as Netflix and Spotify, but has also fueled Disney’s recent success. Unlocking a large repertoire of scientific studies by business scholars and entertainment economists, the authors identify essential factors, mechanisms, and methods that help a new entertainment product succeed. The book thus offers a timely alternative to “Nobody-Knows” decision-making in the digital while coupling a good idea with smart data analytics and entertainment theory cannot guarantee a hit, it systematically and substantially increases the probability of success in the entertainment industry. Entertainment Science is poised to inspire fresh new thinking among managers, students of entertainment, and scholars alike. Thorsten Hennig-Thurau and Mark B. Houston – two of our finest scholars in the area of entertainment marketing – have produced a definitive research-based compendium that cuts across various branches of the arts to explain the phenomena that provide consumption experiences to capture the hearts and minds of audiences. Morris B. Holbrook, W. T. Dillard Professor Emeritus of Marketing, Columbia University Entertainment Science is a must-read for everyone working in the entertainment industry today, where the impact of digital and the use of big data can’t be ignored anymore.

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,30333785,"In a real-world environment, you can imagine that a robot or an artificial intelligence won’t always have access to the optimal answer, or maybe there isn’t an optimal correct answer. You’d want that robot to be able to explore the world on its own, and learn things just by looking for patterns. <br /> <br />Think about the large amounts of data being collected today, by the likes of the NSA, Google, and other organizations. No human could possibly sift through all that data manually. It was reported recently in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal that the National Security Agency collects so much surveillance data, it is no longer effective. <br /> <br />Could automated pattern discovery solve this problem? <br /> <br />Do you ever wonder how we get the data that we use in our supervised machine learning algorithms? <br /> <br />Kaggle always seems to provide us with a nice CSV, complete with Xs and corresponding Ys. <br /> <br />If you haven’t been involved in acquiring data yourself, you might not have thought about this, but someone has to make this data! <br /> <br />A lot of the time this involves manual labor. Sometimes, you don’t have access to the correct information or it is infeasible or costly to acquire. <br /> <br />You still want to have some idea of the structure of the data. <br /> <br />This is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play. <br /> <br />In this book we are first going to talk about clustering. This is where instead of training on labels, we try to create our own labels. We’ll do this by grouping together data that looks alike. <br /> <br />The 2 methods of clustering we’ll talk about: k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. <br /> <br />Next, because in machine learning we like to talk about probability distributions, we’ll go into Gaussian mixture models and kernel density estimation, where we talk about how to learn the probability distribution of a set of data. <br /> <br />One interesting fact is that under certain conditions, Gaussian mixture models and k-means clustering are exactly the same! We’ll prove how this is the case. <br /> <br />Lastly, we’ll look at the theory behind principal components analysis or PCA. PCA has many useful applications: visualization, dimensionality reduction, denoising, and de-correlation. You will see how it allows us to take a different perspective on latent variables, which first appear when we talk about k-means clustering and GMMs. <br /> <br />All the algorithms we’ll talk about in this course are staples in machine learning and data science, so if you want to know how to automatically find patterns in your data with data mining and pattern extraction, without needing someone to put in manual work to label that data, then this book is for you. <br /> <br />All of the materials required to follow along in this book are free: You just need to able to download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Sci-kit Learn.",57.0,14,1,,"May 22, 2016",3.64,"Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Cluster Analysis, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Principal Components Analysis"

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,30238998,"This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in Theano and TensorFlow, and you know how to run code using the GPU. <br /> <br />This book is all about how to use deep learning for computer vision using convolutional neural networks. These are the state of the art when it comes to image classification and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST. <br /> <br />In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the StreetView House Number (SVHN) dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles - so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge! <br /> <br />Because convolution is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as modeling artificial organs like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to audio, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for image effects, like the Gaussian blur and edge detection. <br /> <br />After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset. <br /> <br />All the materials used in this book are FREE. You can download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Theano, and TensorFlow with pip or easy_install. <br /> <br />Lastly, my goal is to show you that convolutional networks aren’t magical and they don’t require expert-level math to figure out. <br /> <br />It’s just the same thing we had with regular neural networks: <br /> <br />y = softmax( relu(X.dot(W1).dot(W2) ) <br /> <br />Except we replace the first “dot product” with a convolution: <br /> <br />y = softmax( relu(conv(X, W1)).dot(W2) ) <br /> <br />The way they are trained is exactly the same as before, so all your skills with backpropagation, etc. carry over.",52.0,15,1,,"May 15, 2016",3.53,"Convolutional Neural Networks in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Deep Learning in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow"

AI Publishing,Kindle Edition,51236067,"This book is for you. This book works as guide to present fundamental Python Libraries and basis related to Data Visualization using Python. Data science and data visualization are two different but interrelated concepts. Data science refers to the science of extracting and exploring data in order to find patterns that can be used for decision making at different levels. Data visualization can be considered as a subdomain of data science where you visualize data with the help of graphs and tables in order to find out which data is most significant and can help in the identification of important patterns. This book is dedicated to data visualization and explains how to perform data visualization on a variety of datasets using various data visualization libraries written in the Python programming language. It is suggested that you use this book for data visualization purposes only and not for decision making. For decision making and pattern identification, read this book in conjunction with a dedicated book on machine learning and data science. We will start by digging into Python programming as all the projects are developed using it, and it is currently the most used programming language in the world. We will also explore the most-famous libraries for Data Visualization such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc . You will learn all about python in three modules, one for Plotting with Matplotlib, one for Plotting with Seaborn, and a final one Pandas for Data Visualization. All three modules will contain hands-on projects using real-world datasets and a lot of exercises. All solutions in this book are extensively tested by a group of beta readers. The solutions provided are simplified as much as possible so that they can serve as examples for you to refer to when you are learning a new skill. This book is written with one goal in mind – to help beginners overcome their initial obstacles to learning Data Visualization using Python. A lot of times, newbies tend to feel intimidated by coding and data. The goal of this book is to isolate the different concepts so that beginners can gradually gain competency in the fundamentals of Python before working on a project. Beginners in Python coding and Data Science does not have to be scary or frustrating when you take one step at a time.

Lazy Programmer,Kindle Edition,30526284,"Recently, Microsoft’s Twitter bot “Tay” was released into the wild, and quickly began making racist and hateful statements after learning from other Twitter users. The technology behind this? Natural language processing. <br /> <br />NLP is the use of machine learning algorithms for problems that involve text. <br /> <br />Do you ever wonder why you get much less spam in your inbox these days compared to 10 years ago? What kinds of algorithms are people using to do spam detection? How can they take words in an email and know how to compute whether or not it’s spam? In this book you are going to build your very own spam detector. <br /> <br />Did you know people have already used Twitter to determine the current sentiment about a particular company to decide whether or not they should buy or sell stocks? Having a machine that can decide how people feel about something is immensely useful and immediately applicable to revenue optimization. In this course you are going to build your own sentiment analyzer. <br /> <br />Are you an Internet marketer or are you interested in SEO? Have you ever wanted to know how you can automatically generate content? In this course we are going to take a first crack at building your own article spinner. You’ll learn to write programs that can take an article as input and spit out a similar article with different words as output. This can save you tons of time and thousands of dollars if you’re paying someone to write content for you. <br /> <br />Natural Language Processing, or as it is often abbreviated, NLP - is the use of programming and math to do language-based tasks. <br /> <br />If you have Windows or iOS then you have NLP right in front of you! Cortana and Siri are applications that take what you say and turn it into something meaningful that can be done programmatically. <br /> <br />The key point: NLP is highly practical. NLP is everywhere. <br /> <br />This book is split up into multiple sections based on the various practical tasks that you can do with NLP: <br /> <br />Before we do any real programming exercises we’ll look at common NLP tasks (some of these we will actually code ourselves, the others are mentioned so you at least know they exist). We will then look at common data pre-processing techniques used for text. As you’ll see, this preprocessing is what will actually take up a majority of your time when you’re doing NLP. <br /> <br />The first programming exercise we’ll do is look at how to build a spam detector. Your email inbox uses this, so it’s clearly very useful and it’s been the subject of study for a long time. <br /> <br />Next we’ll look at “sentiment analysis” and you’ll build your own “sentiment analyzer”. This is how a computer can judge how positive or negative some text is based on the words and phrases that are used. This is also immediately practical - some people have analyzed Twitter feeds to predict whether a stock would go up or down. <br /> <br />After that we’ll look at the NLTK library. This is a very popular library that solves a lot of fundamental problems in NLP - and you can use it in conjunction with other libraries in your data analysis pipeline. <br /> <br />Next we’ll look at “latent semantic analysis”. This is basically doing dimensionality reduction on text - and it helps us solve the problem of 2 words having the same meaning. It also helps us interpret our data and save on computation time. <br /> <br />Lastly, we’ll talk about one of the most popular applications of NLP - article spinning. This is very practical for internet marketers and entrepreneurs.",54.0,17,1,,"May 17, 2016",4.18,"Natural Language Processing in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning for spam detection, sentiment analysis, latent semantic analysis, and article spinning"
