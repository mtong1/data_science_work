## Learning Objectives from Engineering for One Planet Framework

* "Apply relevant concepts from required disciplines to the study of real-world problems
and their solutions with empathic and ethical consideration for communities/societies,
environmental justice, and cultural awareness."
* "Examine data about environmental issues (e.g., climate change, energy and water use, scarcity and
pollution, air quality, waste management, toxicity, etc.) including consideration for past/current/
future and local/regional/global impacts"
* " Describe how engineering activities directly and indirectly cause positive and negative social/
cultural impacts throughout the design life-cycle, both to workers producing the products (i.e.,
labor practices, livelihood, health, etc.) and to communities, society, and non-human life (i.e.,
resources acquisition, waste production and management, traditional/cultural methodologies, etc.)."


## Sustainability-related Questions 
* I'm curious what measures are being taken now on a government/higher level that is aimed at funneling more resources into impoverished communities who are unequitably affected by exposure to hazardous materials, polluted air, etc?
* What are ways that data can be used effectively in pushing for change in environmental injustice?
* What are roles that data scientists take that are more climate-minded versus what other data scientists take? How may skills differ? 

# Exercise 3.2 Data
a)
```{r}
# load package 
library(lterdatasampler)

# load data 
data("ntl_icecover")

# assign data to new variable 
ntl <- ntl_icecover
```

b) There are 334 units of observation, noting the year and duration of ice sticking in various lakes
 
```{r}
# c) First 12 rows of data
head(ntl,12)

# d) List of all variable names
names(ntl)
# e) Class of lakeid and ice_off variables
class(ntl$lakeid)
class(ntl$ice_off)
# f) All unique entries of lakeid variable
levels(ntl$lakeid)
```
